# Data Science & Machine Learning Capstone Project

This is my (Guillermo Tarras√≥) capstone project for the Data Science & Machine Learning course from Coding Nomads.

The aim of this project is to develop and train two Machine Learning-based diagnostic classification models to differentiate Thalassemia Carrier states based on full blood count and/or Haemoglobin variants.
### Models:
- Using the first dataset above will differentiate between normal individuals and alpha thalassemia carriers. 
- The second will differentiate between the two types of alpha carriers: silent carrier and alpha thalassemia trait, with the latter having more obvious clinical and biochemical changes and a higher risk of transmitting the disease to the next generation. 

### Repository: 
- capstone_proposal_Thalassemia.md is a text file with the background and a brief description of the design of the project. 
- alphanorm.xlsx is the first dataset.
- twoalphas.xlsx is the second dataset.
- capstone_report.md is a text file with a summary of the methodology used in the project, the results and the conclusions.
- Thalassemia_alphanorm.ipynb contains the code of the first model.
- Thalassemia_twoalphas.ipynb contains the code of the second model. 
- plotting.py is an accessory file for some of the plots.
